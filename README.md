## 👋 About Me

I am a passionate and versatile technologist with a core focus in **game programming & design** and a strong affinity for my recently-found passion, **cybersecurity**. I thrive at the intersection of complex systems, creative problem-solving, and building secure, efficient software. My work spans from analyzing vulnerabilities and understanding attack vectors to architecting and developing interactive experiences.

In game development, my passion extends beyond programming to the **architecture of player interaction**. I specialize in **Game UX/UI Design**, focusing on creating clean, intuitive interfaces, logical control schemes, and feedback systems that feel seamless and empower the player. I believe a well-designed interface is the silent narrator of a game's experience.

I also maintain a secondary GitHub account, **[guildedCucumber](https://github.com/guildedCucumber)**, for academic projects and research prototypes.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **Primary Focus (Game Dev & Cybersecurity):**

*   **[Master's Thesis: Accessibility in Design](https://github.com/helenamartinezpijuan/masters-thesis-accessibility)** | `C#` `Unity`
    An educational 2D platformer designed to simulate and create empathy for the challenges faced by players with disabilities. This research-driven project implements various interaction modes to showcase barriers in traditional game design and proposes UX-centric solutions for a more inclusive gaming experience.

*   **[VPN Monitor & Analyzer](https://github.com/helenamartinezpijuan/vpn-monitor)** | `Bash` `Kali Linux`
    A robust Bash script developed in a Kali Linux environment to monitor, manage, and perform basic security analysis on VPN connections. The tool provides real-time status updates, connection diagnostics, and checks for potential IP/DNS leaks, emphasizing practical network security and automation.

### **Secondary & Experimental Work:**
