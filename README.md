## üëã About Me

I am a passionate and versatile technologist with a core focus in **game programming & design** and a strong affinity for my recently-found passion, **cybersecurity**. I thrive at the intersection of complex systems, creative problem-solving, and building secure, efficient software. My work spans from analyzing vulnerabilities and understanding attack vectors to architecting and developing interactive experiences.

In game development, my passion extends beyond programming to the **architecture of player interaction**. I specialize in **Game UX/UI Design**, focusing on creating clean, intuitive interfaces, logical control schemes, and feedback systems that feel seamless and empower the player. I believe a well-designed interface is the silent narrator of a game's experience.

I also maintain a secondary GitHub account, **[guildedCucumber](https://github.com/guildedCucumber)**, for experimental projects, game jams, and research prototypes.
